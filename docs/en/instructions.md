# Usage Instructions

In this section of the documentation, we will prepare our PC to start developing in Odoo using  
**ROCKETDOO**.

***For developers who prefer to work with Windows and WSL2, as we saw on the previous page, your PC should already be ready with all the initial tools installed.***

For those working on Linux operating systems, we will detail the necessary tools that must be installed to get started.

## Tools required before Rocketdoo

1. Keep your Linux packages up to date.  
2. Have GIT installed or verify that it is installed:

~~~
git --version
~~~

Or install it:

~~~
sudo apt install git -y
~~~

3. Have Visual Studio Code installed.  
4. Have Python’s package manager `pip` installed.  
5. Install Docker and Docker Compose using the official guide shared on the **Get Started** page.  
6. Install the basic extensions in VSCode:  
    - Docker  
    - Dev Container  

And most importantly, install the **ROCKETDOO** framework:

~~~
sudo pip install rocketdoo
~~~
or
~~~
sudo pipx install rocketdoo
~~~

> We recommend using ***pipx*** if you want it to be installed globally on your machine without breaking Python dependencies.
